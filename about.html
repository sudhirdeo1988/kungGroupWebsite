                  Jocelyn gave TKG its start as a contract Faculty Member at
                  Oracle University, where she designed and taught management
                  courses. She consulted at Cisco, organizing one of their first

                  Transitioning to 1 Billion. Jocelyn also held executive
                  positions as VP of Human Resources for Esprit de Corp and Sam
                  and Libby, Inc. She was a Faculty Member for Management Center
                  Europe, training hundreds of executives on leadership skills
                  and before that, she consulted at the Tarkenton Productivity

                  manufacturers including: Continental Can; James River Paper;
                  and Honeywell. Additionally, Jocelyn served as Training
                  Director of Fireman’s Fund Insurance Companies, implementing

                  Jocelyn discovered her passion and innate gift for teaching
                  leadership over 30 years ago, when she attended management
